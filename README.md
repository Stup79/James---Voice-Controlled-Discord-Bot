# James - A Voice Controlled Discord Bot

This is James. A voice activated and controlled discord bot. It also includes the forward and convolutional neural network models, as well as their code for training, which are used to make the bot find out when his trigger word "James" has been spoken. 

Note that Discord does not allow bots to actually listen to the voice chat. But I can use my own audio to feed into the bot and then let him talk to everyone via discord.
